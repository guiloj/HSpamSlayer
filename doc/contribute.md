# Contributing rules

-   You must always change a docstring if your changes make them incorrect.
-   You must always add a docstring to any new functions.
-   You must always explain your changes.
-   You must always follow the [google template](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings) for docstrings:

    ```py
    """
    This is an example of Google style.

    Args:
        param1 (type): This is the first param.
        param2 (type): This is a second param.

-   You must always respect others.
-   You must always make your functions [statically typed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html):

    ````py
    def foo(bar: str) -> str:
        """
        Add the string `bar` to the end of the string "foo: " and return it.

        Args:
            bar (str): The string to be appended.

        Returns:
            str: Result of the appended string.

        Example:
        ```py
        >>> foo("bar")
        foo: bar
        ```
        """
        return f'foo: {bar}'
    ````
